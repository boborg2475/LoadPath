# Scale measurements

The slice-6a table (API.md "Slice 6a"): what the engine costs today on structures ten and a
hundred times the fixtures, measured before any scale design. Every row is a `Slow.Scale.*`
case in `tests/ScaleMeasurementTest.cpp`, Release build, run one case per process by the
orchestrator. Times are the case's own `steady_clock` readings, not wall clock.

Machine: the owner's Windows 10 workstation (the one that runs the suite; MSVC 2022, `/O2`,
Eigen 3.4 dense). Dates are the run dates.

## Rows, 2026-10-11 (HEAD 8d05593)

| Structure | Pieces | Joints | Components | Elastic | Certificate | Judge | Cascade: one post removed | Cascade: base course of wall 0 removed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Wall 10 × 8 (dry) | 86 | 227 | 1 | 50 ms, Stands | 878 ms, Stands | 104 ms, Stands | n/a | 2,652 ms, **0 passes, Undecided** |
| Shed (12 × 8 plan, 10 courses, 2 bays, door + window) | 420 | 1,090 | 5 | 282 ms, Stands | 6,877 ms, Stands | 527 ms, Stands | 579 ms, 0 passes, Stands | 1,927 ms, 1 pass, Stands |

Pieces count the ground. The shed's five components are its four walls and the timber frame,
joined only through the ground (the corners are not bonded and the frame does not bear on the
walls). Judge is the combined authority: every component solved alone by the elastic authority,
Mechanism and Undecided refereed by the certificate.

## What the first rows say

- **The certificate dominates at rest.** On the shed it is 13× the judge and 24× the elastic
  solve, and the judge calls it only for the components the elastic field cannot decide. A
  cascade pass that releases pays for it on every component it touches.
- **A floating wall is Undecided, not released.** Removing the 10 × 8 wall's base course leaves
  76 bricks with no path to the ground; the cascade returns Undecided with zero passes after
  2.6 s, where a single floating brick releases as one cluster (CascadeTest). The shed's wall
  releases under the same removal. Pinned by a red test in the slice-6a round; the dev round
  owns it.
